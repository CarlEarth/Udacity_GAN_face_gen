# Udacity_GAN_face_gen

This is the assignment in Udacity Deep Learning Course.
The following is what we can learn from this project:

1. Preprocess the image data before training  
2. Build the Discriminator and Generator in the GAN model 
3. The loss behavior during the trining 

Program Instruction:
Open the notebook with the jupyter notebook.
Follow the instrcutions step by step.

The training result:
The most of the outputs look like real images.
(Due to the training resources, the resolution of picture is not high.)
